# **Questify â€“ Gamified Habit Tracker**

## **Live Demo**
ðŸ”— [Questify Live Site](https://wykesj.github.io/IP_WebApp_Questify/)

## **Overview**  
Questify is a **gamified habit tracker** that transforms productivity into an **RPG-style adventure**. Designed for users who struggle with **motivation and consistency**, it encourages habit-building through **quests, stat growth, and progression-based rewards**.  

By completing **tasks, tracking habits, and engaging in battles**, users earn **XP, level up, and improve their character stats (Strength, Vitality, Intelligence, Agility)**â€”all while working toward **real-life self-improvement**. The system ensures **intrinsic and extrinsic motivation**, keeping users engaged through **achievements and structured leveling mechanics**.  

Unlike traditional habit trackers, Questifyâ€™s **battle quest system** introduces an **interactive challenge** where users defeat a boss by completing daily quests, reinforcing **consistency and accountability**. The app uses **real-time updates via the Supabase API**, ensuring seamless integration across **habit tracking, inventory, and quest mechanics**.  

Questify is designed to make personal growth **fun, rewarding, and engaging**, helping users stay consistent in their habits while feeling like theyâ€™re **on a heroic journey**.  

---

## **Design Process**  
Questify is built for users who:  
- **Struggle with motivation** â€“ They want to build habits but find it difficult to stay consistent.  
- **Enjoy gaming mechanics** â€“ They respond well to RPG elements like **XP, levels, and progression**.  
- **Need structured goal-setting** â€“ They want clear, achievable daily tasks with **tangible rewards**.  

Many existing habit trackers rely on **basic checklists**, which fail to engage users long-term. Questify bridges this gap by making habit-building **interactive and rewarding**, ensuring **different types of motivation (competition, mastery, progression, and autonomy)** are considered.  

To achieve this, Questify follows **three key design principles**:  
1. **Stat Growth & Progression** â€“ Users see **visible improvements** in their character stats as they complete habits.  
2. **Quest-Based Engagement** â€“ Introduces **boss battles and challenges** to reinforce daily consistency.  
3. **Real-Time API Integration** â€“ Ensures **dynamic data updates** for **tasks, inventory, and quests** across all pages.

- **As a user**, I want to track my habits **easily and consistently**, so I can **stay motivated**.  
- **As a player**, I want to **earn XP and level up**, so I feel a **sense of progress** when completing tasks.  
- **As a strategy-focused player**, I want to use **inventory items to enhance my stats**, so I can **optimize my performance**.  
- **As a challenge-seeker**, I want **boss battles that require me to complete tasks**, so I feel **accomplished when I win**.
